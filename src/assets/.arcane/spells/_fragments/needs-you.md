**Needs you — required operator actions.** When this run leaves an action that only the operator can take, and the work is not correct or complete until it is taken, report it in one block at the very top of the final report, before every other section and before any optional next step:

```markdown
## ⚠ Needs you

- <exactly what to do: the command, the link, or the question> — <why the agent cannot do it itself>
```

- **What belongs in it:** an action the work needs that only the operator can take — approving or merging a pull request, accepting a decision record, answering a question the work is waiting on, confirming a `guarded` push, running an interactive command such as `spell unblock-push`, or a step on an external platform the agent cannot reach. An optional suggestion, a next spell to run, or anything the agent could do itself is not a required action and stays out of the block.
- **One line per action.** Say exactly what to do, then, after the dash, why the agent cannot do it. Write the command, link or question out in full; never point elsewhere with "see above".
- **Never only among optional steps.** An action required for correctness is never listed only under next steps, suggestions, `Carry Forward` or `What's Next?`. It may be repeated there, but it always appears in this block.
- **Omit it when empty.** When nothing needs the operator, leave the block out entirely: no heading and no "None" line.
- **Every final report.** The block belongs in whatever report ends the run, including a report written when the spell stops early.
- Enforcement: explicitly advisory prose (ARC-023) — no check reads a spell's actual output for this block; it holds by these instructions alone.
